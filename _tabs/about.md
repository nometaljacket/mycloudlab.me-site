Hello site visitors! My name is Connor Renfeld, and welcome to MyCloudLab. I am an aspiring cloud engineer and cloud architect, looking to expand my horizons and knowledge of cloud platforms, especially those managed by Amazon. This site will serve to professionally document my forays into the platform, in addition to whatever peaks my interest within the general realm of information technologies.

As mentioned above, this site is designed with a few differing purposes in mind, all relating to my usage of [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/), or "AWS". I am currently looking to grow my understanding of Amazon's cloud platform and I plan to use it, as documented on this site, for a variety of purposes. Following are what I expect to be the most frequent use cases of the site:

1. Documenting projects I take up within the AWS sphere, in addition to whatever I learn or discover over the course of working on these projects
2. Providing a hosting platform for any public-facing projects I create for users to experiment with
3. Present career-relevant information about myself to the outside world such that potential employers might get a more holistic grasp of who I am, what I am interested in, and what my skills are

Please feel free to look around or reach out to me using the email widget in the bottom left corner!
